# pi-alibaba-models

The complete [`pi`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) extension for Alibaba's model lineup — **Qwen 3.8 Max**, **Qwen 3.7 Max / Plus**, **Qwen 3.6 Max / Plus**, **DeepSeek V4 Pro**, **Kimi K2.6**, **GLM-5**, **MiniMax M2.5**, and the rest of the catalog. Native thinking-level support, Anthropic Messages plus OpenAI Chat Completions **and Responses**, International / China / US / workspace endpoints, both Coding Plan subscriptions and pay-per-token Cloud keys.

## Features

- **Dual Provider Support**: Both the subscription-based Model Studio Coding Plan **and** the pay-per-token Alibaba Cloud (DashScope) — registered side by side, switch per chat from the model picker.
- **Three API Shapes**: Anthropic-compatible (`/v1/messages`) by default; OpenAI Chat Completions (`/compatible-mode/v1`) auto-selected for DeepSeek and selectable per-Cloud via `/alibaba`; OpenAI **Responses** (`/compatible-mode/v1/responses`) as a third Cloud format.
- **Five+ Regions**: International (`dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com`), China, US-Virginia, Hong Kong, plus Alibaba's recommended **workspace domains** `{WorkspaceId}.{region}.maas.aliyuncs.com` for Beijing / Singapore / Tokyo / Frankfurt / US — switch with `/alibaba`, no re-login needed. Shared regional domains are **auto-upgraded** to the matching workspace domain when the WorkspaceId is discoverable and the candidate passes a probe.
- **Native Reasoning**: First-class thinking-level support for every reasoning-capable model, including `reasoning.effort` on Responses and Completions effort maps for Qwen 3.8 / GLM-5.x / DeepSeek V4.
- **DashScope sidecar tools** (opt-in): one Pi tool, `alibaba_tools`, for live web search, page extract, code interpreter, and image search. Off by default. Does not change the chat API format.
- **Vision Capable**: Image input automatically enabled for VL models, Qwen 3.8, Qwen 3.x Plus variants, and Kimi.
- **Live Catalog**: Cloud prefers Alibaba's native `GET /api/v1/models` (real context windows, max output, capability tags, pricing) and falls back to compatible-mode `/models`. Plan still uses the live `/compatible-mode/v1/models` list. New models appear as Alibaba ships them — no extension update needed.

## How to Use (Quickstart)

1. **Install** the extension (see below).
2. **Restart** `pi` to load the extension.
3. Type `/login` in your pi chat input.
4. Select your provider based on your account type:
   - Choose **Plans > Alibaba Model Studio Coding Plan** if you have a subscription (your token likely starts with `sk-sp-` or `sk-tok-`).
   - Choose **Use an API key > Alibaba Cloud (API Key)** if you use the pay-as-you-go DashScope service (your token likely starts with `sk-`).
5. Paste your token when prompted.
6. Open the model picker, select a model (e.g., `Qwen 3.8 Max`, `Qwen 3.7 Plus`, or `DeepSeek V4 Pro`), and start chatting!

## Install

```bash
# recommended
pi install pi-alibaba-models

# explicit npm form (fallback if the bare name doesn't resolve)
pi install npm:pi-alibaba-models

# or from GitHub
pi install git:github.com/Fornace/pi-alibaba-models

# or from a local checkout (development)
git clone https://github.com/Fornace/pi-alibaba-models
cd pi-alibaba-models && pi install .
```

After install, restart `pi`. The extension registers two providers and a slash command on every boot.

## Uninstall

`pi remove` only removes the package entry from `settings.json["packages"]` — it does not clean extension-private state (auth entries, config, model cache, enabled-model lists). For a clean uninstall:

```text
1. /alibaba  →  "Reset all"      (wipes config, both auth entries, plan-models cache, alibaba-* enabledModels)
2. pi remove pi-alibaba-models
```

If you've already run `pi remove` and want to clean leftovers manually:

```bash
rm -f ~/.pi/agent/alibaba-config.json ~/.pi/agent/alibaba-plan-models.cache.json ~/.pi/agent/alibaba-cloud-models.cache*.json
# then edit ~/.pi/agent/auth.json and remove the "alibaba-plan" / "alibaba-cloud" entries
# then edit ~/.pi/agent/settings.json and drop any "alibaba-*/..." or "dashscope/..." entries from enabledModels
```

## Two providers

| Provider id    | Section in `/login`     | Auth shape | Use it for                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `alibaba-plan` | Plans                   | OAuth (paste token) | Model Studio Coding Plan subscription |
| `alibaba-cloud`| API Keys                | API key | Pay-per-token DashScope API           |

Plan is registered as an `oauth` provider (paste token in `/login`). Cloud is registered as an API-key provider (`apiKey: "$DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"`) and shows up under `/login → Use an API key`; credentials are stored as `{ type: "api_key", key }`. Older Cloud entries saved in OAuth shape are migrated to that API-key record. The Plan provider stores the chosen endpoints in the `refresh` field as JSON; the Cloud provider stores its domain in `~/.pi/agent/alibaba-config.json`.

> **Cloud without `/login`:** the Cloud provider also reads the `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` environment variable. If it's set, the extension fetches your live model catalog from it on startup — no `/login` needed. With **no** credential at all (no `/login`, no env var) the Cloud provider still shows up in `/login → Use an API key` via a single placeholder model, so you can sign in; your real catalog replaces it the moment a key is present.

### Endpoints

**Plan (default Singapore / Global):**
- Anthropic-compat: `https://token-plan.ap-southeast-1.maas.aliyuncs.com/apps/anthropic` (pi appends `/v1/messages`)
- OpenAI-compat:    `https://token-plan.ap-southeast-1.maas.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1`

**Cloud (default International):**
- Anthropic-compat: `https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/apps/anthropic`
- OpenAI-compat:    `https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1` (Chat Completions **and** Responses)

> **OpenAI Responses API** (`/compatible-mode/v1/responses`): Alibaba's newest OpenAI-compatible surface, with `reasoning.effort` thinking levels. Select it per-Cloud via `/alibaba → Cloud — Change API Format → OpenAI Responses`. Built-in DashScope tools are **not** mixed into that chat stream (pi still sends its own agent tools). Enable them separately with `/alibaba → Cloud — DashScope built-in tools`: that registers `alibaba_tools`, which makes its own Cloud request (Responses, or Completions `enable_search` for a cheap search) using a Qwen model. DeepSeek stays on Chat Completions when the Cloud format is Anthropic (that path hangs); on Responses it follows the selected format (Beijing/Singapore per Alibaba's docs).

## Key prefix reference

| Prefix      | Provider       | Where to obtain                                                   |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sk-sp-`    | `alibaba-plan` | Model Studio Coding Plan console — Singapore / Global             |
| `sk-tok-`   | `alibaba-plan` | Model Studio Coding Plan console — alternate token format         |
| `sk-`(other)| `alibaba-cloud`| DashScope API Keys console (per-token billing)                    |

Consoles:
- International / Singapore Coding Plan: <https://modelstudio-intl.console.alibabacloud.com/>
- China Coding Plan:                     <https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/>
- DashScope (per-token):                 <https://dashscope.console.aliyun.com/> or <https://dashscope-intl.console.aliyun.com/>

The login flow validates the prefix and offers to redirect you to the correct provider if you paste the wrong type.

> Workspace domains are the ones Alibaba recommends (and they're required for Japan/Frankfurt). `/alibaba → Cloud — Change Domain` asks for your business-space ID and builds the host — the ID discovered by the auto-upgrade pre-fills the prompt (blank input reuses it).

### Workspace-domain auto-upgrade

Although Alibaba's docs say the WorkspaceId is console-only, the key's workspace is discoverable: `GET /api/v1/models/limits` returns `workspace_id` on every quota row — even on the shared domains where the endpoint itself is undocumented. So on boot (and on `session_start`, which covers logging into Cloud mid-session), when the Cloud endpoint is one of the three shared regional domains (`dashscope.aliyuncs.com` → Beijing, `dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com` → Singapore, `dashscope-us.aliyuncs.com` → US), the extension:

1. reads the `workspace_id` bound to your key (cached value as fallback),
2. probes `{WorkspaceId}.{region}.maas.aliyuncs.com` with a cheap catalog GET,
3. **only if the probe succeeds**, saves it as the new Cloud domain and logs the switch.

A failed probe changes nothing and retries at most once per 24h. Hong Kong, custom, and already-workspace domains are never touched. Picking a shared domain explicitly via `/alibaba → Cloud — Change Domain` counts as “stay here” and disables the auto-upgrade; manage it anytime via `/alibaba → Cloud — Auto workspace domain` (detect now / enable / disable). `/alibaba → Status` shows the current state (`Auto-WS`) and the discovered WorkspaceId.

**Swapping the API key between runs:** once on a workspace domain, boot pays zero network — nothing re-validates the key automatically. A same-region swap is a non-event: DashScope authenticates the key, not the wsid↔key pairing (verified empirically — a workspace subdomain serves any valid key of the site). A key from another **site** (CN ↔ International ↔ US do not share keys) would 401 on requests; run `Detect & upgrade now` in that case — it verifies the current key against the configured domain and, when rejected, rediscovers the workspace across all shared domains (current region first) and switches. If no workspace is discoverable but a shared domain accepts the key, it **demotes** to that shared domain and disables the auto-upgrade (so it cannot flip back into the same failure); re-enable from the same menu later. There is deliberately **no boot-time fallback**: demotion requires positive probe evidence from an explicit menu action, never a transient network error at launch.

### Rate limits

`/alibaba → Rate limits (Cloud)` queries `GET /api/v1/models/limits` with your API key and prints each model's quota. Read-only and best-effort — the endpoint is currently only documented on the **Beijing workspace domain**.

### Authorized-models filter

`GET /api/v1/models/permissions` returns the models your business space is authorized to call. When the endpoint is reachable (Beijing workspace domain), the extension intersects it with the live catalog and hides models you don't have inference permission for. On by default; disable via `/alibaba → Cloud — Authorized-only Filter`. If the fetch fails or the intersection would be empty, the full catalog is shown.

## Studio plan models — dynamic source

The plan model list is fetched from the canonical Qwen Code template:

<https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/blob/main/packages/cli/src/constants/codingPlan.ts>

Model catalogs are cached by **pi itself** (its provider models store): the extension returns them from `refreshModels`, pi persists the snapshot, restores it offline at startup, and re-fetches on its own freshness schedule. A failed fetch keeps the previous list (and, with none, registers an empty list rather than crashing). `/alibaba → Refresh model lists` forces a refresh through `ctx.modelRegistry.refresh({force: true})`.

The Cloud provider prefers Alibaba's native `GET /api/v1/models` (paginated, text-generation models) and falls back to compatible-mode `/v1/models` on domains that don't expose it. Qwen 3.8 Max, Qwen 3.7 Max/Plus, DeepSeek V4, Kimi, GLM-5, MiniMax etc. all surface automatically as Alibaba ships them.

## Limitations & Known Issues

- **DeepSeek Compatibility**: The Anthropic-compatible path on the Alibaba Plan host often hangs or times out for DeepSeek models. To resolve this seamlessly, this extension automatically forces any model ID containing `deepseek` to use the **OpenAI-completions endpoint** instead.
- **Model Availability (404s)**: When `GET /api/v1/models/permissions` is reachable, the picker shows the catalog your account is authorized to call. Toggle with `/alibaba → Cloud — Authorized-only Filter`. On other domains the advertised catalog is shown and a model you can't access still errors only when you send a message.
- **API Wrapper Quirks**: Alibaba's native Anthropic compatibility layer can occasionally be strict or quirky with complex parallel tool calls. If you experience systemic parsing errors on DashScope, switch Cloud API format to "OpenAI Chat Completions" or "OpenAI Responses".
- **Responses API**: not every model supports every built-in DashScope tool, and `xhigh`/`max` effort are documented for Beijing/Singapore. If a model errors out, switch back to Chat Completions or Anthropic for that session.
- **`alibaba_tools`**: Cloud key required (`/login` or `$DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`). Qwen only — 3.7 Max / 3.6 Plus+ search is Responses-only. Completions search does not return source URLs; Responses search/research can. Auto sidecar model prefers Flash/Plus over Max. Search usage is billed on the sidecar call. A silent hang should not happen: the tool card streams elapsed time and built-in calls. Sidecar 429s and transient `server_error` backend failures (`Backend buffer overflow`) retry inside the tool (user sees `429 / server_error, retrying…`; the model only gets the final result). If it still times out, narrow the task or raise `ALIBABA_SIDECAR_TIMEOUT_MS`.
- **Output budget vs. thinking budget**: On the Anthropic path, `max_tokens` is a **total** budget shared between thinking and the final answer. pi splits the card's `maxTokens` accordingly, so a card value of 8192 leaves only 8192 − 7168 = **1024 tokens** for the actual answer at high thinking — enough to truncate large tool calls (e.g. big `write`/`edit` content) mid-arguments. The card therefore reports the model's own catalog `max_output_tokens` whenever the catalog has a row (clamped at 131072 — e.g. `qwen-plus` = 32768, which yields a 16384-token answer budget at high thinking). Models with **no** catalog row keep a conservative fallback (32768; 8192 for non-reasoning ids and the open-weight `qwen3-<size>b` line, measured at 8192), because overshooting the real ceiling is rejected outright with `Range of max_tokens should be [1, N]`. Completions and Responses keep the catalog's larger output ceilings.
- **Dynamic Caching**: Model lists live in pi's models store (offline snapshot at startup, freshness-gated network refresh). If a new model drops and you don't see it, run `/alibaba` -> `Refresh model lists`.
- **Prompt caching & cache warming**: caching-capable families declare `promptCache: {short: 300}` (DashScope's documented 5-minute ephemeral window, renewed on a hit), which makes them eligible for pi 0.86+'s prompt-cache warming — the global `cacheWarming` setting (`off` / `streaming` / `idle`) decides when warming happens. No `long` tier is declared (none is published). The open-weight `qwen3-<size>b` line has no documented caching and is never warmed. On the Cloud **Responses** format each request additionally carries `x-dashscope-session-cache: enable` — DashScope's server-side session cache gives predictable multi-turn prefix hits (reads billed at ~10% instead of the implicit cache's 20–25%; cache writes at 125%; 5-min window renewed on hit). It is documented for the Responses endpoint only, so Completions/Anthropic requests stay unmarked.
- **Inferred Context Windows**: Compatible-mode `/v1/models` returns only ids and names, so context windows are inferred from the model id unless native `/api/v1/models` supplied a real value. If a brand-new model shows the wrong size, fix it yourself with `/alibaba → Context Window — Override` (per model, or `*` for all) — no extension update needed.

Enable `alibaba_tools`, then ask the agent for live docs or news. Typical calls:

```text
alibaba_tools({ action: "search", task: "Hangzhou weather tomorrow" })
alibaba_tools({ action: "research", task: "What changed in DashScope web_search this week?" })
```

Default to **`search`**. `research` (search + extractor + interpreter, thinking on) is slower and only worth it when search was too thin. The sidecar **streams** into the tool card (heartbeat every 4s) so a long call is not a silent hang. Limits: 3 min for search/code/image, 8 min for research — override with `ALIBABA_SIDECAR_TIMEOUT_MS`. Chat format is unchanged.

## Troubleshooting

- **Model picker shows "No matching models"** → run `/login`, pick the right Alibaba entry, paste your key. Models register only after a successful login (Cloud fetches its real model list at boot from the live key).
- **`sk-sp-` accidentally pasted into the Cloud slot** → run `/alibaba → Re-login Cloud`, then `/login → Alibaba Model Studio Coding Plan` and paste it there. (The login validators will also catch this and offer to redirect you.)
- **DeepSeek hangs / times out** → make sure you're on the latest version of this extension; it forces DeepSeek to OpenAI-compat. If you customised plan endpoints, verify the OpenAI URL ends in `/compatible-mode/v1`.
- **Plan picker shows models that 404 at request time** → your subscription tier may not include every advertised model. The picker shows whatever upstream advertises; the API tells you "model_not_found" only when you actually call it.
- **`Error: server_error: <429> InternalError.Algo: ... [Too many requests.]`** → DashScope wrapped a rate limit inside a 200 SSE `error` event. Chat auto-retries via pi; `alibaba_tools` retries inside the tool card (`429, retrying n/3…`). If retries still fail, wait a minute (RPM windows reset ~60s) or `/alibaba → Rate limits (Cloud)`.
- **`Error: server_error: Backend buffer overflow.`** → transient DashScope inference-backend failure, not a problem with your request. Chat auto-retries via pi (the extension marks bare variants retryable); `alibaba_tools` retries inside the tool card (`server_error, retrying n/3…`). If it keeps failing, wait a minute and resend, or switch model/region.
- **`/alibaba` command doesn't appear** → `pi list` should show `pi-alibaba-models` (or whatever source you installed from) under "User packages". If absent, run `pi install pi-alibaba-models` again and restart `pi`.
- **`alibaba_tools` missing** → it is off by default. `/alibaba → Cloud — DashScope built-in tools → Enable`, then `/reload` or restart. Needs a Cloud key.

## Files

All paths live in pi's config directory — `~/.pi/agent` by default, or `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` when that override is set (the extension resolves them via pi's `getAgentDir()`).

| Path                                                  | Purpose                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`                               | Both provider credentials (0600)   |
| `~/.pi/agent/alibaba-config.json`                     | Endpoint / domain / format config  |
| `~/.pi/agent/alibaba-config.json`                             | endpoints, domain/format, toggles, catalog fetch timestamps |

Model catalogs are **not** written by the extension anymore — pi's provider models store keeps them (restored offline at startup).
